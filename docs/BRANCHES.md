# Branch Architecture and Guidelines
## Naming
Branches should be named in the following format: `{TYPE}/{COMMIT}-{YEAR}`.
The `{TYPE}` should be what type of contribution will your branch provide, such as: `feat`, `fix`, `patch`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.
The `{COMMIT}` should be your message, such as: `update-release-notes`, `migrate-codebase-to-rust`, `fix-ouath`, etc.

Examples of branch names are:
* `docs/update-release-notes-2025`
* `refactor/migrate-codebase-to-rust-2025`
* `patch/fix-hydration-error`
* `fix/update-ouath-logic`

## Guidelines
* Branches should offer real contributions, not a simple "Update README.md" commit.
* Contribution to core features *is* allowed on certain core features, useless or redundant contributions to core features will be ignored.
