# Pull Requests

> [!TIP]
> For branch names please refer to [BRANCHES.md](BRANCHES.md)

Pull Requests (PRs) should offer meaningful contributions that improve the project. Please avoid sending PRs that don’t add real value.

## ✅ "Do"s

* **Patch a bug** Fix errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior in the code.
  *Example:* Fixing a broken API call in a backend route.
* **Improve developer experience** Make it easier for contributors to work on the project.
  *Example:* Adding clear error messages, improving logging, or enhancing documentation for a feature.
* **Improve user experience** Make the app/interface smoother, more intuitive, or more accessible.
  *Example:* Improving navigation flow or fixing a misaligned button.
* **Contribute to backend logic** Add or optimize functions, improve data handling, or fix database queries.
  *Example:* Optimizing a search query to reduce response time.
* **Improve user interface(s)** Enhance visual design, responsiveness, or accessibility.
  *Example:* Adding proper contrast for readability or fixing a broken layout on mobile devices.
* **Commit a fix** Address an issue reported in the issue tracker.
  *Example:* Closing a bug ticket by implementing a solution.
* **Improve performance** Optimize code, reduce memory usage, or speed up critical paths.
  *Example:* Refactoring a loop to handle large datasets more efficiently.

## ❌ "Don't"s

* **Commit extremely minor or trivial changes** Avoid PRs that do not substantially benefit the project.
  *Example:* Changing only a single line in `README.md` without meaningful improvement.
* **Send incomplete or experimental code** PRs should be functional and tested.
  *Example:* Committing half-finished features without a clear plan or explanation.
* **Duplicate existing work** Make sure your PR isn’t already covered by an open PR or branch.
* **Include unnecessary files** Avoid adding personal files, debug logs, or IDE configs unless relevant.
  *Example:* Adding `.DS_Store` or local environment files.
* **Change coding style arbitrarily** Follow the project’s style guide; don’t change formatting without reason.
* **Ignore failing tests** – PRs should pass all existing tests and not break the build.
